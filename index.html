    <p> Covid-19 has brought many significant impacts to various aspects in our society and our world. Academic institutions are one of the most impacted areas in societies, globally, from covid-19, in terms of:</p>
        <ul>
             <li>classroom operations
             <li>grading methods
             <li>transition into education on online platforms
        </ul>
    <p>The students' performances have been greatly influenced by these accomodations. Due to covid-19 guidelines and restrictions, many schools had to accomodate rapidly to these sudden changes. It is imperative to note how these changes impact student learning, student acheivement, and further academic instructions in the long run. With the new variants to covid-19 getting introduced to the world, countries around the world are exploring the best ways to contain the virus in public places, including schools. </p>

    <p>Based on the data from 13 countries with U.S. institutions having the largest percentage of representation of 94%, most of the academic institutions globally made the deicision of moving entirely to remote or online classes for the rest of the semester due to covid-19. The data was collected through a series of rapidly developed practice impact surveys. The survey focused primarily on grading and transcript practices. Most academic institutions have transtitioned to remote or online classes for the remainder of the term, while some only made announcement of the transition to remote/online learning, some anoounced to move to remote/online classes on a specific date, and some conducted remote/online classes with in-person lab classes, respectively from largest to smallest percentage. Although there are some variations to each accomodations, all schools are transitioning into remote/online classes to practice distance learning in response to the highly contagious covid-19 spread.

<div>
    <p> Non-qualitative grades used in academic institutions globally have also changed due to covid-19. Non-qualitative graders are utilized throuhgout the covid-19 pandemic instead of the traditional numerical or letter grades to take account for the sudden, unexpected changes in students' learning environment and curriculum. Non-qualitative grades provide students with some leeway with their academic acheivements. Students' educational hardships arising from no interaction with their peers and the instructor while they learn is also taken into consideration on top of the individual remote learning. In response to the covid-19, most of the academic institutions, with the highest percentage of 84%, used non-qualitative grades rather than numerical or letter grades in the spring semester of 2020, such as satisfactory/unsatisfactory, pass/fail, credit/no credit, and so on as it is listed in the graph above.

    <p> As schools have made changes in their methods of education due to the covid-19, the most popular method was transitioning to online platforms for remote learning and changes in school day for in-person learning. The most popular remote learning modalities was through online platforms. Other remote learning modalities include television, radio, mobile devices, take home packages that are paper-based, and tutoring. Adjustments to regular school days was the most popular method for in-person academic supports. Changes in school day are incorporated as additional educational support being offered to mitigate leanring loss among students. The graph focsues only on the two nost popular methods for remote learning and in-person learning. North America had the highest percentage of academic institutions transitioning to online platforms and making changes in school days globally.
